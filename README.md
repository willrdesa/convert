## Author
William De Sa

## Description
My implementation of Owl Tech ’s number base conversion utility .

## Build Instructions
‘‘‘bash
gcc -o convert convert .c main .c
./ convert
‘‘‘

## Test Results
[X/Y tests passed - paste summary here ]
100/100 tests passed - tested basic conversion tests, edge cases, powers of base, large numbers, mixed base tests, and special cases.

## Notes
[Any interesting discoveries or challenges ]
Struggled with comparing the results from print_tables, had to tweak it a little so it would take another input. Searched up a lot of things that were not in the original pdf.
